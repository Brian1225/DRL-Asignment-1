## DRL HW1 Q4
### 1. Environment Set up
- Please run the below code to build all the required dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train a DQN model
- Please run the following python script, the arguments as shown below.

    1. `n_episodes`: number of episodes to in the training loop
    2. `buffer_size`: the size of the replay buffer to store the trajectories 
    3. `batch_size`: batch size to perform one update
    4. `update_step`: number of steps per episode to update the parameters in the target Q-network
    5. `DECAY_RATE`: the decay speed of epsilon (which will be applied as `epsilon *= decay_rate`)
    6. `gamma`: discount factor of the cumulative rewards
    7. `alpha`: learning rate
    8. `tau`: the soft update ratio of the target Q-network, respecting to the current Q-network ($Q_{target} = (1 - \tau) * Q_{target} + \tau * Q$)
```
python train.py --n_episode NUM_OF_EPISODES --buffer_size BUFFER_SIZE --batch_size BATCH_SIZE --update_step NUM_OF_UPDATE_STEPS --decay_rate DECAY_RATE --gamma GAMMA --alpha â‰ˆ --tau TAU
```
- Also, it has provided a bash script to easily incoporate the tuning process within the training process, which can be realize with the below command.
```
bash train.sh
```
- After the above training procedure, the trained model will be store in an automatically created folder, `/checkpoints` under current folder.

### 3. Evaluate the Trained Agent
- First, please modify the input argument of `agent.Q.load_state_dict()` in `student_agent.py`.
- Then, run `python simple_custom_taxi_env.py`, and the final score will be shown in the traminal.
